As owners of the website's content, staff members from each unit are responsible for creating, updating, and removing content on their respective website(s).
These resources will help ensure that your website features high quality content while looking good.\n\n\nA Section’s title should clearly, concisely and completely describe the page’s content. The Section title will appear on top of the page, in the site navigation menu, and in the website breadcrumbs. Each layout should have a unique title to distinguish it from others on the website.
Use simple and commonly used terminology. Avoid abbreviations, wordplay and academic jargon. Do not use department slogans or marketing phrases as page titles. All titles must be in Title Case."
